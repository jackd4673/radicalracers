<b>The Wall Climbing, Gravity Defying RC Racers!</b>

Equipped with a super suction turbine that keeps them in constant contact with the surface, Radical Racers are the next level in RC racing! Radical Racers go vertically on the wall, sideways, around, under, and all over. Tune in to your child's creative development by creating their very own obstacle courses where they can interact and have races with friends!

The multidirectional remote control puts you in the driver's seat to race, spin, and hang upside down with super precision and speed. Premium quality detailing with realistic glowing headlights and rear taillights, this Racer resembles a real-life race car in action! With gnarly drifts and wicked 360 degree spins, Radical Racers are the best gift to find under the Christmas tree. 

Unlike most RC racer toys, Radical Racers are designed with an onboard rechargeable battery operated power plant. With premium velocity and speed, Radical Racers are constructed from super polytech so they're durable and designed to endure. Turn out the lights all over your house, and have a radical race with the whole family! Soar upside down, under a table, over the door or donuts all over the floor. Radical Racers are the perfect holiday gift the whole family can enjoy!
